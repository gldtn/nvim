Neovim Config Lab ðŸ§ª

Welcome to my Neovim setup, where code meets controlled chaos. Stacked with everything needed to make dev life smoothâ€”Neogit for version sorcery, feline for a polished statusline, and fzf-lua for hunting files like a rogue. Itâ€™s simple but flexible, with color schemes for every mood and scripts to handle the rest. Perfectly geared for whatever coding quest comes my way.

Huge thanks to all the dotfile wizards out there on GitHubâ€”your configs and ideas brought this setup to life. This Neovim setup is a bit of a Frankensteinâ€™s monster, so feel free to explore, tweak, and use at your own risk! Itâ€™s optimized for my workflow, but with a few adjustments, it might just fit yours too.
