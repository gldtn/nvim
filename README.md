###Neovim Config Lab ðŸ§ª

Welcome to my Neovim setup, where code meets controlled chaos. Stacked with everything needed to make dev life smoothâ€”Neogit for version sorcery, feline for a polished statusline, and fzf-lua for hunting files like a rogue. Itâ€™s simple but flexible, with color schemes for every mood and scripts to handle the rest. Perfectly geared for whatever coding quest comes my way.
