Neovim Lab ðŸ§ª

Welcome to my Neovim setup, where code meets controlled chaos.

Huge thanks to all the dotfile wizards out there on GitHubâ€”your configs and ideas brought this setup to life.
This Neovim setup is a bit of a Frankensteinâ€™s monster, so feel free to explore, tweak, and use at your own risk!
Itâ€™s optimized for my workflow, but with a few adjustments, it might just fit yours too.
