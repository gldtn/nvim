# gldtn/nvim

My personal Neovim configuration.

## Features

- Plugin management powered by Lazy.nvim
- Language support via LSP with Mason and custom handlers
- Conform for fast and simple formatting
- Lualine statusline
- Fzf-lua for fuzzy finding
- Theming with Catppuccin and Tokyonight (will add others soon)

## Requirements

- Neovim v0.12
- Ghostty 1.2+ (Theme switching also changes Ghostty themes)

## About This Version

This configuration is a complete refactor built around a more minimal, focused plugin set.
The goal of this rebuild is to stay lightweight, fast, and clean. Only the essentials, thoughtfully configured.
